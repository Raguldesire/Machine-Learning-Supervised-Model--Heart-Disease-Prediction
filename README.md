# Machine-Learning-Supervised-Model--Heart-Disease-Prediction

## Process Flow:
# 1.problem statement:
  Predicting heart disease in a person
# 2.Application:
  Create a ML model to analyse and predict the disease in a person using certain factors that are provided in a dataset
# 3.Data science problem statement:
  We have a target to predict heart disease--so it was a Supervised Model
  I use Logistic Regression Model to predict the classification dependent variable
# 4.Data Exploration:
  Checking the features in a dataset
# 5.Data cleaning and Preprocessing:
  Checking Null values and datatypes
# 6.Choosing Model:
  Logistic Regression
# 7.Train the model:
# 8.Model Evaluation:
  Accuracy and precision
# 9.Building predictive sample:
